libseccomp: An Enhanced Seccomp (mode 2) Helper Library
===============================================================================
http://libseccomp.sf.net

The libseccomp library provides and easy to use, platform independent,
interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp.  The
libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall
filter language and present a more conventional function-call based filtering
interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application
developers.

* Documentation

The "doc/" directory contains all of the documentation aside from the README
file (this file) and the LICENSE file which can be found in the top level
directory.

Those who are interested in contributing to the the project are encouraged to
read the SUBMITTING_PATCHES in the top level directory.

* Building and Installing the Library

In order to build the library you should follow the familiar three step
process used by most applications which leverage autotools for the build
process:

	# ./configure
	# make [V=0|1]
	# make install

As usual, running "./configure -h" will display a list of build-time
configuration options.

* Testing the Library

There are a number of tests located in the "tests/" directory and a make target
which can be used to help automate their execution.  If you want to run the
standard regression tests you can execute the following after building the
library:

	# make check

Be warned that the test run can take a while to run and produces a lot of
output.

* Other Useful Tools

The "tools/" directory includes a number of tools which may be helpful in the
development of the library, or applications using the library, but for various
reasons are not installed by default.
